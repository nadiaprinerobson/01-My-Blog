Audience: People interested in agriculure who are not familiar 
Hello all, my name is Nadia and I love agriculture. I grew up on a small beef farm, participated in the National FFA Organization, and studied agriculture in college. Over my time in agriculture, I have seen a common, and unfortunate problem: majority of the public does not understand agriculture. In today's society, it seems as if people are more than ever removed from where their food comes from. If you ask people where their food comes from, they more often than not say the grocery store. The grocery store is the place where most consumers come in contact with their food, it is important for people to be aware of where and how their food is grown. A recent survey reported by Ciston PR Newswire suggests that 72% of Americans know little to nothing about farming and where their food comes from (PR Newswire). Throughout agriculture classes. we are taught that less than 2% of the population directly work with production agriculture. This disconnect has created multiple misconceptions that people have about agriculture. In this blog, I will explore and discuss many topics that people misunderstand when it comes to agriculture. 
For example, many believe that ag is an outdated practice where farmers wake before sunrise and work endlessly until sundown. While they still put in long hours, ag has lot more modern practices and utilizes technology more than ever. The next blog post will look at recent innovations and technology in agriculture and their impacts. Another common misconception is that you have to live out in a rural area to farm, which thanks to urban farming, is not the case anymore. 
Agriculture has a massive impact on our country, economy, and lives. There are many misconceptions that society has about agriculture; hopefully, week by week we will look at different topics that people might have the wrong impression on.
