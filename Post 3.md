Rolling hills, vast fields, and rows of crops often come to mind when thinking of agriculture and farming. But what if I told you that you could easily grow vegetables on your rooftop? As crazy as it sounds, rooftop gardening is a part of urban agriculture, a growing trend in agriculture. Urban agriculture is when you grow produce or raise livestock in an urban area. Urban agriculture dates back to as early as 1890 when Detroit’s then-mayor Hazen Pingree created a plan to grow potatoes in the city. To this day, Detroit leads the country as the city with the most urban gardens with almost 3000. As nation grew and evolved, so did urban agriculture. The 1940's saw Victory Gardens and an increase in smaller, unconventional gardens. The USDA established the Urban Gardening Program in the 1970s. This program expanded education and assistance to large cities with an interest in starting urban gardens. With the help of Urban Farming, an organization with the goal of spreading urban agriculture, there are over 65000 urban gardens across the world (). 

Like traditional farming, urban farming can take different forms. Backyard gardens are a simple and common variation of urban farming. Many people have these and they can be small scale and easy to maintain. Rooftop gardens, as mentioned earlier, are one of the unique ways that city residences can grow food. Gardens are placed on the roofs of residence buildings, businesses, and other areas in a city. Other popular spots for gardens are vacant lots. Often times, gardens on rooftops and vacant lots are community projects with multiple people taking care of it. The harvest is then split between the group and residences. What produce you can grow in these gardens varies greatly. Depending on climate and circumstances, gardens can produce anything from strawberries to peppers to avocados. Factors to consider when thinking about what to plant are climate (you won’t have much luck growing oranges in Minnesota), the amount of space available (good luck growing lettuce in a small space), and your needs (don’t grow anything you won’t eat or couldn’t donate). While it is unlikely that city residences will be able to properly raise cattle, sheep, or larger livestock, chickens are occasionally allowed. One of my friends actually raises chickens in her backyard where she also gathers the eggs. Guidelines and laws on raising chicken varies by city.  Beekeeping is another way to help support agriculture in an urban area. Bees help pollinate not just vegetables, but also native plants. They can benefit gardens and the rest of the urban landscape. 

Urban agriculture has many benefits to the environment and the community. Growing and producing food in an urban city provides fresh food for communities that does not have readily available and helping with food security. Something else that is a common issue is smog and pollution. While gardens cannot single handedly help solve global warming, they can release oxygen and clean the air. By having more readily avaiable food, it cuts down on transportation and emissons.
