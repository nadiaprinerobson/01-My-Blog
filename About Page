Hello and Welcome to Unconventional Agriculture,

Every since I was young, I have loved learning about agriculture. Growing up we all learn that milk comes from cows and vegetables are grown in soil. However, there is so much more to that. Agriculture feeds the world using some cool technology and techniques, including robots, rooftops, and raised beds. On this blog, we will explore and research different ways to farm, grow food, raise cattle, and feed the world that you donâ€™t typically hear about.
