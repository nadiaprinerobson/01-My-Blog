Imagine your stereotypical farm. You're probably imagining a farmer driving an older tractor in a field. Images like these are part of a larger idea that many people have that insists that agriculture is an old and outdated practice. Nowadays, that is further from the truth. What if instead of a farmer driving a tractor, the tractor drove itself? GPS technology enables tractors to guide themselves in fields.  Technology has advanced tremendously over the past 50 years allowing many farmers to go from just a horse to 5000 horsepower. 
Drones have rapidly become a part of many farms. They also incorporate GPS technology to perform various tasks on a farm. Drones can help with precision pesticide placement, land analytics, crop and livestock health, and other important variables. They give farmers a bords eye view and new perspective on their crops. Farmers are able to keep a closer eye on their fields with more data and insight. While drones may seem like unobtainable technology, they are being utilized in agriculture to make it more efficient. In fact, the technology advancements in agriculture are about making production more efficient. Robots in agriculture is another example of this. Now, don't picture a robot with overalls on and plowing a field. Robots are used in agriculture to assist farmers with tedious tasks. There are robots specifically designed to help with pest control including weed pulling and pesticide spraying. Harvesting is another area of farming where robotics are helpful. Robots can work in the fields all hours of the day and without needing breaks. While it has become a concern that robots will be displacing people from their jobs, but robots are actaully helping. In the U.S., skilled labor is not as easy to find as before. The lack of labor could have a negative effect in agriculture production. Robotics are filling the gap.  
Agricutlure today relies heavily on technology to ensure that production can keep up with the growing demands. This technology is far from the old fashioned tractors and tools used before. Drones and robots are at the forefront of technology that is bringing agricutlure into the future.
