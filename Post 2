Imagine your sterotypical farm. You're probably imagining a farmer driving an older tractor in a field. Iamges like these are part of a larger idea that many people have that insists that ag is an old and outdated practice. Nowadays, that is furthur from the truth. What if instead of a farmer driving a tractor, the tractor drove itself? GPS technology enables tractors to guide themselves in fields.  Technology has advanced tremendously over the past 50 years allowing many farmers to go from just a horse to 5000 horsepower. 
Drones have rapidly become a part of many farms. They also incorporate GPS technology to perfom various tasks on a farm. Drones can help with precison pesticide placement, land analystics, crop and livestock health, and other important variables. While drones may seem like unuptanable technology, they are being utilized in agricutlure to make ag more efficent. In fact, the technology advancements in agriculture are about making production more efficent. Robots in agriculture is another example of this. Labor Now, don't picture a robot with overalls on and plowing a field. Robots are used in agriculture to assist farmers with tedious tasks. There are robots specifically desinged to help with pest control including weed pulling and pesticide spraying.
